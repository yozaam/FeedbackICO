      Faculty Feedback doesn't make sense, do you believe the teachers cannot see our ratings?<br>
      And how do we judge the influence of every student?
    </h1>
    
    <h3>
      Also, what's stopping me from giving dishonest feedback,
    </h3>
    <h4>Maybe I give everyone 100%</h4>

   
      We need a baseline, and in this competive world; the best way to do that is to rate teachers relative to each other;
      
 <hr>
    Everyone gets 12 coins for the semester, which they may use to give their teachers, this is the infinity coin;
  <br><br>
    But each student may get only 12. <br>
    They must distribute this among their faculty; 
    <br><br><br>
    Giving all to their favorite;
    <br><br>
    Or distributing it to their 'friends' to vote on their behalf
    <br><br>
    Every faculty starts out with 0 in their wallet, but may end the semester with multiple;
    <br><br>
    This is where the market comes in: teachers may sell their coins, reducing their balance; <br>
    Which brings us to the question, why?
<br><br>
    -> 'Bonus' Passive Income for excellent teachers, an 'incentive' to teach well
    <br><br>
    -> A way of transferring income from the other teachers to the better ones.
    <br><br>
    -> A way for the college to measure performance
    <br><br>
    -> Instills a sense of capitalistic demcracy amongst students, as the students with a high balance are going to be very influential;
    <br><br>
    -> Commitees with a high balance will automatically be seen as better
    <br><br>
    -> This is because one can see how many coins were sent out ( not to whom ) in the end of the semester if the student wishes to make this data public
